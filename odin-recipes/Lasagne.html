    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Prepare this easy homemade lasagne ahead of time and save in the freezer, uncooked, for when you need it during a busy week. Then just bake for an extra 45 mins.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
<li>2 Tablespoon olive oil</li>
<li>750g Lean beef mince</li>
<li>100g Cheddar cheese</li>
<li>Tomato sauce</li>
<li>200ml Beef stock</li>
<li>Grated nutmeg</li>
<li>300g Fresh lasagne sheets</li>
<li>White sauce</li>
<li>125g Mozzerella</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Step by step</h3>
    <ol>
<li>To make the meat sauce, heat 2 tbsp olive oil in a frying pan and cook 750g lean beef mince in two batches for about 10 mins until browned all over.</li>
<li>Finely chop 4 slices of prosciutto from a 90g pack, then stir through the meat mixture.</li>
<li>Pour over 800g passata or half our basic tomato sauce recipe and 200ml hot beef stock. Add a little grated nutmeg, then season.</li>
<li>Bring up to the boil, then simmer for 30 mins until the sauce looks rich.</li>
<li>Heat oven to 180C/fan/160C/gas 4 and lightly oil an ovenproof dish (about 30 x 20cm).</li>
<li>Spoon one third of the meat sauce into the dish, then cover with some fresh lasagne sheets from a 300g pack. Drizzle over roughly 130g ready-made or homemade white sauce.</li>
    <li>Repeat until you have 3 layers of pasta. Cover with the remaining 390g white sauce, making sure you canâ€™t see any pasta poking through.</li>
<li>Scatter 125g torn mozzarella over the top.</li>
<li>Arrange the rest of the prosciutto on top. Bake for 45 mins until the top is bubbling and lightly browned.</li>
